    "# Abstraction in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Abstraction?\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows programmers to focus on interactions with an object, rather than its internal details. In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Classes\n",
    "An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It acts as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Methods\n",
    "Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract class that must be implemented by its subclasses. The abstract methods are defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example: Medical Equipment\n",
    "Below is a real-world example where abstraction is applied to medical equipment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define an abstract class `MedicalEquipment` and implement it in subclasses `XRayMachine` and `ECGMachine`. These classes simulate turning on the equipment and performing specific diagnostic procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class MedicalEquipment(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def turn_on(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perform_diagnosis(self, patient_name):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class XRayMachine(MedicalEquipment):\n",
    "    def turn_on(self):\n",
    "        return \"X-Ray Machine is now ON.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perform_diagnosis(self, patient_name):\n",
    "        return f\"Performing X-Ray scan for {patient_name}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class ECGMachine(MedicalEquipment):\n",
    "    def turn_on(self):\n",
    "        return \"ECG Machine is now ON.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perform_diagnosis(self, patient_name):\n",
    "        return f\"Recording ECG for {patient_name}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the subclasses\n",
    "xray = XRayMachine()\n",
    "print(xray.turn_on())\n",
    "print(xray.perform_diagnosis(\"John Doe\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "ecg = ECGMachine()\n",
    "print(ecg.turn_on())\n",
    "print(ecg.perform_diagnosis(\"Jane Smith\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another Example: Patient Management System\n",
    "Here is an implementation of a patient management system where abstraction is used to define the common interface for `Patient` subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Patient(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def get_details(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class InPatient(Patient):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, room_number):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.room_number = room_number\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_details(self):\n",
    "        return f\"In-Patient: {self.name}, Room: {self.room_number}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class OutPatient(Patient):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, appointment_time):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.appointment_time = appointment_time\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_details(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Out-Patient: {self.name}, Appointment Time: {self.appointment_time}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the subclasses\n",
    "in_patient = InPatient(\"Alice Brown\", \"301A\")\n",
    "print(in_patient.get_details())\n",
    "\n",
    "out_patient = OutPatient(\"Bob White\", \"10:30 AM\")\n",
    "print(out_patient.get_details())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Abstraction in Python is a vital concept for creating flexible and reusable code. It allows developers to define clear contracts for subclasses to follow, ensuring consistency across implementations. In the examples above, we demonstrated how abstraction can be applied to simulate real-world scenarios in the medical field.\n"
