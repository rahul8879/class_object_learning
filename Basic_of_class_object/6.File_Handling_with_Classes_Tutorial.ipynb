    "# File Handling with Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to File Handling\n",
    "File handling allows us to work with files in Python for reading, writing, and appending data. Using classes for file management provides a structured and reusable way to handle file operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Operations\n",
    "1. **Writing data to a file**: Save data to a file on disk.\n",
    "2. **Reading data from a file**: Retrieve data stored in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Classes for File Management\n",
    "- Encapsulation of file handling logic.\n",
    "- Code reusability and better organization.\n",
    "- Easy extension and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: FileManager Class\n",
    "Below, we create a `FileManager` class with methods to write data to a file and read data from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FileManager:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
    "        self.filename = filename\n",
    "\n",
    "    def write_data(self, data):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Writes data to the file.\"\"\"\n",
    "        with open(self.filename, 'w') as file:\n",
    "            file.write(data)\n",
    "        return f\"Data written to {self.filename}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def read_data(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Reads data from the file.\"\"\"\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            with open(self.filename, 'r') as file:\n",
    "                return file.read()\n",
    "        except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "            return \"File not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the FileManager class\n",
    "file_manager = FileManager(\"example.txt\")\n",
    "print(file_manager.write_data(\"Hello, World!\"))\n",
    "print(file_manager.read_data())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Student Attendance Logger\n",
    "In this example, we create a `StudentAttendance` class to log attendance records and retrieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class StudentAttendance:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
    "        self.filename = filename\n",
    "\n",
    "    def log_attendance(self, student_name, date, status):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Logs attendance for a student.\"\"\"\n",
    "        with open(self.filename, 'a') as file:\n",
    "            file.write(f\"{date},{student_name},{status}\\n\")\n",
    "        return f\"Attendance logged for {student_name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_attendance(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Retrieves all attendance records.\"\"\"\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            with open(self.filename, 'r') as file:\n",
    "                records = file.readlines()\n",
    "            return [record.strip().split(',') for record in records]\n",
    "        except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "            return \"Attendance file not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the StudentAttendance class\n",
    "attendance = StudentAttendance(\"attendance.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging attendance\n",
    "print(attendance.log_attendance(\"Alice\", \"2024-12-11\", \"Present\"))\n",
    "print(attendance.log_attendance(\"Bob\", \"2024-12-11\", \"Absent\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieving attendance\n",
    "for record in attendance.get_attendance():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example: Log Management System\n",
    "A log management system is used to handle system or application logs. Below is a `LogManager` class to log messages with timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "class LogManager:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, logfile):\n",
    "        self.logfile = logfile\n",
    "\n",
    "    def log_message(self, message, level=\"INFO\"):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Logs a message with a timestamp and severity level.\"\"\"\n",
    "        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n",
    "        with open(self.logfile, 'a') as file:\n",
    "            file.write(f\"[{timestamp}] {level}: {message}\\n\")\n",
    "        return \"Log entry added.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def read_logs(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Reads all log entries.\"\"\"\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            with open(self.logfile, 'r') as file:\n",
    "                return file.readlines()\n",
    "        except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "            return \"Log file not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the LogManager class\n",
    "log_manager = LogManager(\"system.log\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging messages\n",
    "print(log_manager.log_message(\"System initialized.\"))\n",
    "print(log_manager.log_message(\"An error occurred.\", \"ERROR\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieving logs\n",
    "for log in log_manager.read_logs():\n",
    "    print(log.strip())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Using classes for file handling improves code organization and makes it easier to reuse and maintain file operations. The examples above demonstrate writing and reading data, as well as managing specific use cases like student attendance and system logs.\n"
