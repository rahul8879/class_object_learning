    "# Static and Class Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Static and Class Methods?\n",
    "Python provides three types of methods in a class: instance methods, static methods, and class methods. Each serves a unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Methods\n",
    "- Require access to the object (instance) itself.\n",
    "- Use `self` as the first parameter.\n",
    "- Can access and modify instance-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods\n",
    "- Do not require access to the object or class itself.\n",
    "- Use the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "- Typically used for utility or helper methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods\n",
    "- Work on the class level instead of the instance level.\n",
    "- Use `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
    "- Use the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "- Can access and modify class-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Utility Class to Check Even Numbers (Static Method)\n",
    "Static methods are used when the behavior of a method does not depend on class or instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Utility:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def is_even(number):\n",
    "        return number % 2 == 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing the static method\n",
    "print(Utility.is_even(10))  # True\n",
    "print(Utility.is_even(15))  # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Counter Class to Track Object Creation (Class Method)\n",
    "Class methods can be used to manipulate class-level attributes. Below, we use a class method to track how many objects of the `Counter` class have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    object_count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        Counter.object_count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_object_count(cls):\n",
    "        return f\"Number of Counter objects created: {cls.object_count}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects and testing the class method\n",
    "c1 = Counter()\n",
    "c2 = Counter()\n",
    "c3 = Counter()\n",
    "print(Counter.get_object_count())  # Output: Number of Counter objects created: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example: Medical Diagnosis Tracker\n",
    "Below is an example of a class `Diagnosis` used in a healthcare application. It includes:\n",
    "1. A static method to check if a temperature is indicative of fever.\n",
    "2. A class method to keep track of the number of diagnoses made.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Diagnosis:\n",
    "    total_diagnoses = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, patient_name, temperature):\n",
    "        self.patient_name = patient_name\n",
    "        self.temperature = temperature\n",
    "        Diagnosis.total_diagnoses += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def has_fever(temperature):\n",
    "        return temperature > 37.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_total_diagnoses(cls):\n",
    "        return f\"Total diagnoses made: {cls.total_diagnoses}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating diagnoses and testing methods\n",
    "d1 = Diagnosis(\"Alice\", 36.8)\n",
    "d2 = Diagnosis(\"Bob\", 38.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Diagnosis.has_fever(36.8))  # False\n",
    "print(Diagnosis.has_fever(38.2))  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Diagnosis.get_total_diagnoses())  # Output: Total diagnoses made: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Static methods are ideal for utility functions, while class methods are powerful tools for working with class-level data. Together, they provide flexibility and clarity in Python class design.\n"
