    "# Authentication and Authorization - Theory Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication and authorization are critical aspects of modern web applications to ensure secure and controlled access to resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Authentication Basics\n",
    "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that only legitimate users can access the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Credentials**: Information provided by the user, like username and password, to prove identity.\n",
    "- **Authentication Flow**: The steps taken to verify a user's credentials.\n",
    "- **Token**: A piece of data issued after successful authentication, used for subsequent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "1. User sends a login request with username and password.\n",
    "2. The system verifies the credentials against the database.\n",
    "3. If valid, the system generates a token (e.g., JWT) and sends it to the user.\n",
    "4. The user includes this token in future requests to access protected resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. JWT Authentication\n",
    "JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token format widely used for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of JWT:\n",
    "- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., type and algorithm).\n",
    "- **Payload**: Contains claims or data, like user ID and roles.\n",
    "- **Signature**: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How JWT Works:\n",
    "1. User logs in and the server generates a JWT.\n",
    "2. The token is signed with a secret key.\n",
    "3. The token is sent to the user and included in requests as a header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).\n",
    "4. The server verifies the token before granting access to resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- **Header**:\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"alg\": \"HS256\",\n",
    "    \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Payload**:\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"sub\": \"john\",\n",
    "    \"roles\": [\"user\"],\n",
    "    \"exp\": 1682700000\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Signature**: Created using the header, payload, and secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. OAuth2 with Password Flow\n",
    "OAuth2 is a widely-used framework for access delegation. The Password Flow allows direct authentication using a username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. User sends credentials to the `/token` endpoint.\n",
    "2. Server validates credentials and returns an access token.\n",
    "3. User includes the access token in future requests to access protected resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- Centralized authentication.\n",
    "- Token-based approach eliminates the need to send credentials repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n",
    "RBAC restricts access to resources based on a user's roles. Each role is associated with specific permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Roles:\n",
    "- **Admin**: Can manage users and view all resources.\n",
    "- **User**: Can access their own data but not administrative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RBAC Works:\n",
    "1. User logs in and receives a token with role information.\n",
    "2. The server verifies the role during each request.\n",
    "3. If the user lacks the required role, access is denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Implementing Role-Based Access Control\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Define roles and permissions in the application.\n",
    "2. Add role information to the user's JWT token.\n",
    "3. Create a dependency to enforce role checks on endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "- **Admin Endpoint**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  async def admin_only(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):\n",
    "      if \"admin\" not in user.roles:\n",
    "          raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Access denied\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Handling Permissions Using Dependencies\n",
    "FastAPI allows permission checks via dependencies, making the code modular and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Create a dependency function to check permissions.\n",
    "2. Attach the dependency to protected endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def role_required(required_roles: List[str], user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):\n",
    "    if not any(role in user.roles for role in required_roles):\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Insufficient permissions\")\n",
    "    return user\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/admin\")\n",
    "def admin_dashboard(user: User = Depends(lambda: role_required([\"admin\"]))):\n",
    "    return {\"message\": \"Welcome to the admin dashboard!\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "1. **Authentication** ensures the user is who they claim to be.\n",
    "2. **JWT** provides a secure, stateless way to manage user sessions.\n",
    "3. **OAuth2 Password Flow** simplifies token generation.\n",
    "4. **RBAC** enforces access control based on roles.\n",
    "5. **Dependencies** in FastAPI modularize permission handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these concepts, you can create secure and scalable authentication and authorization mechanisms for your applications.\n"
